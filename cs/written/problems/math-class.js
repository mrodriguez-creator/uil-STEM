  { id: "mc13", topic: "Math Class", difficulty: 3, question: "To generate a random integer from 1 to 6 (inclusive), which expression is correct?", choices: ["<code>(int)(Math.random() * 6)</code>", "<code>(int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1</code>", "<code>(int)(Math.random() * 7)</code>", "<code>(int)(Math.random() * 6 + 1)</code>", "Both B and D"], answer: 4, hint: "You need values 1–6; random()*6 gives 0.0 to 5.999...", explanation: "Both (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1 and (int)(Math.random() * 6 + 1) produce values 1–6." },
  { id: "mc14", topic: "Math Class", difficulty: 2, question: "What type does <code>Math.round(double)</code> return?", choices: ["<code>int</code>", "<code>double</code>", "<code>float</code>", "<code>long</code>", "<code>short</code>"], answer: 3, hint: "round(double) returns a 64-bit integer type", explanation: "Math.round(double) returns long. Math.round(float) returns int." },
  { id: "mc15", topic: "Math Class", difficulty: 3, question: "What does <code>Math.round(-2.5)</code> return?", choices: ["&minus;3", "&minus;2", "&minus;2.0", "2", "3"], answer: 1, hint: "Java rounds .5 toward positive infinity", explanation: "Math.round(-2.5) = -2. Java's round uses 'round half up' semantics: -2.5 + 0.5 = -2.0, then floor gives -2." },
