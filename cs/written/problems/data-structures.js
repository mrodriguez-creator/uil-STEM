  { id: "ds1", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 1, question: "A Stack follows which ordering principle?", choices: ["FIFO (First In, First Out)", "LIFO (Last In, First Out)", "Random access", "Priority-based", "Sorted order"], answer: 1, hint: "Think of a stack of plates — you remove the top one first", explanation: "A Stack is LIFO: the last element added (pushed) is the first one removed (popped)." },
  { id: "ds2", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 1, question: "A Queue follows which ordering principle?", choices: ["FIFO (First In, First Out)", "LIFO (Last In, First Out)", "Random access", "Priority-based", "Sorted order"], answer: 0, hint: "Think of a line at a store — the first person in line is served first", explanation: "A Queue is FIFO: the first element added is the first one removed." },
  { id: "ds3", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 2, question: "In a Binary Search Tree (BST), which property must hold for every node?", choices: ["Left child > parent > right child", "Left child < parent < right child", "Left child = parent", "Parent > both children", "Children are always leaves"], answer: 1, hint: "BST organizes smaller values to the left", explanation: "In a BST: all values in the left subtree < node < all values in the right subtree." },
  { id: "ds4", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 2, question: "In a max-heap, which property must hold?", choices: ["Parent ≤ both children", "Parent ≥ both children", "Left child > right child", "The tree is a BST", "All leaves are at the same level"], answer: 1, hint: "In a max-heap, the largest value is always at the root", explanation: "Max-heap: every parent ≥ its children. The root holds the maximum value." },
  { id: "ds5", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 2, question: "In a min-heap, where is the smallest element?", choices: ["A random leaf node", "The leftmost node", "The rightmost node", "The root", "The last level"], answer: 3, hint: "Min-heap keeps the smallest at the top", explanation: "In a min-heap, the root always contains the smallest element." },
  { id: "ds6", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 3, question: "What is the worst-case time complexity of searching in an unbalanced BST with n nodes?", choices: ["O(1)", "O(log n)", "O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(n²)"], answer: 2, hint: "An unbalanced BST can degenerate into a linked list", explanation: "If the BST degenerates into a linked list (e.g., sorted insertions), search is O(n)." },
  { id: "ds7", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 2, question: "What is the time complexity of searching in a balanced BST?", choices: ["O(1)", "O(log n)", "O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(n²)"], answer: 1, hint: "Each comparison eliminates half the remaining nodes", explanation: "A balanced BST has height O(log n), so search is O(log n)." },
  { id: "ds8", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 3, question: "Which data structure uses a hash function to map keys to indices?", choices: ["Binary Search Tree", "Linked List", "Hash Table", "Heap", "Stack"], answer: 2, hint: "It provides O(1) average lookup time", explanation: "A Hash Table (HashMap) uses a hash function to compute bucket indices for fast lookup." },
  { id: "ds9", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 3, question: "What is a collision in a hash table?", choices: ["When the table is full", "When two keys hash to the same index", "When a key is null", "When the load factor exceeds 1", "When a value is overwritten"], answer: 1, hint: "Different keys can produce the same hash value", explanation: "A collision occurs when two different keys hash to the same bucket index." },
  { id: "ds10", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 3, question: "Which collision resolution technique stores colliding elements in a linked list at the same bucket?", choices: ["Open addressing", "Linear probing", "Quadratic probing", "Chaining", "Double hashing"], answer: 3, hint: "Each bucket can hold multiple elements", explanation: "Chaining (separate chaining) stores colliding elements in a linked list at each bucket." },
  { id: "ds11", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 2, question: "A Deque (double-ended queue) supports:", choices: ["Adding/removing at front only", "Adding/removing at back only", "Adding/removing at both front and back", "Random access only", "Priority-based removal"], answer: 2, hint: "Double-ended means both ends", explanation: "A Deque allows insertion and removal at both the front and back." },
  { id: "ds12", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 3, question: "What is the in-order traversal of a BST?", choices: ["Root, Left, Right", "Left, Root, Right", "Left, Right, Root", "Right, Root, Left", "Level by level"], answer: 1, hint: "In-order visits the left subtree, then root, then right subtree", explanation: "In-order traversal: Left, Root, Right. For a BST, this produces sorted output." },
  { id: "ds13", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 3, question: "What is the pre-order traversal order?", choices: ["Root, Left, Right", "Left, Root, Right", "Left, Right, Root", "Right, Root, Left", "Right, Left, Root"], answer: 0, hint: "Pre-order visits the root before (pre) the children", explanation: "Pre-order: Root, Left, Right. The root is visited first." },
  { id: "ds14", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 3, question: "What is the post-order traversal order?", choices: ["Root, Left, Right", "Left, Root, Right", "Left, Right, Root", "Right, Root, Left", "Level by level"], answer: 2, hint: "Post-order visits the root after (post) the children", explanation: "Post-order: Left, Right, Root. The root is visited last." },
  { id: "ds15", topic: "Data Structures", difficulty: 2, question: "A <code>PriorityQueue</code> in Java removes elements in what order?", choices: ["FIFO order", "LIFO order", "Natural (ascending) order", "Descending order", "Random order"], answer: 2, hint: "By default, Java's PriorityQueue is a min-heap", explanation: "Java's PriorityQueue is a min-heap by default, removing the smallest element first (natural ordering)." },
